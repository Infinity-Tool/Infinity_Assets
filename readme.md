# Infinity Assets

Here is the repository to house all assets for the Infinity Tool. It contains a "directory" file that the client uses to know what assets are available including all files with their respective paths.

The poi_tilesets folder contains a high level folder structure of each poi_tileset.

Example directory of a City & Settlement:

## Mega_City

- Mods
- LocalPrefabs
- PoiTileSets (optional selections)
  - MC_Subway
    - Mods
    - LocalPrefabs
  - MC_Spanish_Mission
    - Mods
    - LocalPrefabs
  - MC_Ghostbusers

## Standalone_Cities_and_Settlements

- PoiTileSets
  - Subway
    - Mods
    - LocalPrefabs
  - Spanish_Mission

Note: All files and folders have NO spaces,
and the tool will replace underscores with spaces
when displaying the names.
